AtomicMassProgram
=================

A program that takes in a list of elements and the amounts of them and a mass, and spits out the values for Molar Mass, number of moles, and number of atoms of the first element in the formula

I wrote and ran this program in IDLE, the format for the input is Element symbol, followed by a space, followed by the number of that element in the compound, at the end, there will be a space and then the measured mass.
